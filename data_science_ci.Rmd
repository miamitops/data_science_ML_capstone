## Introduction to machine learning

## Problem Statement

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Dataset overview

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Getting and installing dependencies

## Performing data cleaning and wrangling 

## Summarise the dataset we will use


## Creating a model

## Split the data to Training and Test sets


## Training the Model


## Evaluating the overal sensitivity and specificity of the model


## Testing themodel on the Test Set


## Evaluating accuracy of the test set


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
